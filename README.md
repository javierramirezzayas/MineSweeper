# MineSweeper
This is the first project of ICOM4015. Is a game called MineSweeper.
MineSweeper:
	1. White squares are covered grids.
	2. Gray squares are uncovered grids.
	3. Black squares are mines.
	4. Red squares are flags, which you can access doing a right click on the mouse.
	   The red squares are used to say that there is a potential mine in that specific square 
	   and to block yourself from changing the status of the square. If you want to unblock
	   do a right click on the mouse. 
	5. You lose the game if you press a mine.
	6. You win the game if you uncover all the squares that are not mines.
	7. In the low left corner there is a square indicating the number of mines in the game.
	   It will decrease if you use flags.
